# I Completed Project as under follow:
## (1)HVAC-System
<a href="https://github.com/deep-santani/HVAC-System">HVAC System</a><br>
We build a device that can automatically turn on the cooling system for  the machine whose temperature becomes very high using machine learning and  artificial intelligence. Even in this device, the authenticated person from anywhere can see the  machine's temperature and if he /she feels to turn ON/OFF the cooling system,  he/she can from anywhere.

## This all project available on my github page:<a href="https://github.com/deep-santani">deep-santani</a>
## (2)House price Prediction
## (3)Decision to go comedy show or not (understand from    w3school)
## (4)sales prediction by year
## (5)End to End SAT Score Prediction Score
## (6)Titanic Surviv Prediction WebApp
